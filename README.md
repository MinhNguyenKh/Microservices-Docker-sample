# Step By Step Guideline
1. ### Docker compose:
* Checkout the project from the Git link: https://github.com/MinhNguyenKh/Microservices-Docker-sample.git
* Open the terminal from _**docker-compose**_ directory then run the following commands in the order below:

	`docker-compose -f docker-compose-config.yml up`
	
	`docker-compose -f docker-compose-services.yml up`
	
	`docker-compose -f docker-compose-client.yml up`
	
	`docker-compose -f docker-compose-batch.yml up` ***this batch is only used to update data's status***
	
	Please note that it might take time to start up all the images in the _**docker-compose**_ file depending on machine as well as network. 
	
	Especially, for the _***docker-compose-client.yml***_ please wait until the keycloak server is ready to use:
